Oon schold 1.  byfore him goo

For þat skyle fer & nere

And maked hym lyche þe Erl anone,
And wyþ hys wyff (:) his wyłł to done 
In þe countre of Cornewełł:
In þe Castel of Tyntagełł,
Thus vther, yf y schałł nat lye,
Bygat Arthour in avowtrye.  *. 
Whan vther Pendragon̄ was deed,
Arthour anon was y-crowned; *. 
He was courteys, large, & Gent
To alle puple verrament; 
Beaute, Myȝt, amyable chere
To alle Men ferre and neere;

Ech mon was glad of hys presence,
And drade to do hym dysplesan̄ce;
A stronger Man of hys honde *.

As courteys as any Mayde:—*. 
Þus wryteþ of hym þat hym a-sayde.
At Cayrlyon̄ wythoute fable,  ,

And why þat he maked hyt þus,
Þis was þe resoun y-wyss,—
Þat no man schulde sytt aboue other, *. 
Ne haue indignacioun of hys broþer; 
And alle hadde (.)oo(.) seruyse,
For no pryde scholde aryse
For any degree of syttynge,
Oþer for any seruynge: 
Þus he kept þe table Rounde
Whyle he leuyd on þe grounde.
After he hadde conquered Skotlond *.

Twelf ȝeeris on alle reste

Þere deyde many vnder scheld.

Frollo þat worthy knyght *. 
Proferyd wyth Arthour for to fyght

"Ho hadde þe Maystrie (:) haue þe crown; 
And no mo men but þey two."
Þe day was sett (:) to-geder þey go: *.

Þer was no word y-spoke,
But eche hadde other by þe þrote;

He ros vp raply (:) and smot hym fułł sore;
He dude hym to grent a (.) soueȝ 1. 
Thus they hyw on helmes hye,
And schatered on wyþ scheldes.

Fram þe schulder (:) to þe syde went bytwene
Off frollo / and þan he fell to þe grounde. *. 
Frenscħ men made doełł & wept fułł faste; *.

Than wente Arthour in-to paryse *. 
And toke þe castełł & þe town at hys avyse. 
Worschuped be god of hys grete grace *.

And chered ham wyþ drynk and Mete. *. 
Þey hasted ham to come hoom;
Byfor þe Emperour þey beþ coom; 
Saluted hym as reson̄ ys,
And toke hym þes letterys.
Þey seyde to þe Emperour

Þis was worthy Maynye; 
The kyng of Denmark also was þere,

Went wyþ hym out of lond,
And Many moo sykerly

Arthour toke þan þe lond
To Moddredes owne hond; *. 
He kept al oþer þyng

But he was  of hys kepynge,
As ȝe schałł hure here folewynge.
Now than̄ ys Artour y-Come, *.

Eche man hath take his schuppynge,  ,

And þat hys saule spede þe better, *. 
Lat eche man sey a pater noster. 
¶ Pater noster.
Now god spede Artour wełł!
Hym ys comyng a nyw batełł. *. 
Ther coom a gyant out of spayne,
And rauasched had fayr Elayne; 
He had brouȝt heor vp on an hulle—
Mornyng hyt ys to hure or telle—
Cosyn heo was to kyng Hoell,
A damesel fayr and gentełł; 
And ȝut ferþermore to,
He rauasched heore Moder also. *. 
He dude þe damesel for to dye,
For he myght not lygge heor bye. 
Whan þis was told to Artour,
He maked Much dolour,
And send Bedewer for to spye *. 
How he myght come hym bye; 
And he was nat Sclowh,
But to þe hulle hym drowh
Þat Closed was wyþ water stronge,
Þe hulle a-Mydde gret & longe; 
He went ouer to þe hulle syde,
And þere a fonde a womman̄ byde,
Þat sorwedd & wept Mornynge
Page  12 For Eleynes deþ & departynge, 
And bad Bedewer to fle also
Last he were ded more to;
"For yf þe Gyant fynde þe,
Wythoute dowte he wyłł þe scle." 
Bedwer wyþ ałł hastynge
Tolde Arthour ałł þis þynge.
Amorwe whan þat hyt was day

Bedewer wyþ hym wente, & keye,— 
Men þat cowþe wełł þe weye,—
And broute Arthour Meyntenan̄t

Arthour fowȝt wyþ þat wyght;
He had almost ylost hys Myght:
Wyþ Muche peyne, þruȝ goddeȝ grace
He sclowh þe Geant in þat place,  *. 
And þan he made Bedewere
To smyte of hys heed þere.
To þe Ost he dude hyt brynge,
And þeron was gret won̄drynge, 
Hyt was so oryble & so greet, *. 
More þan any Horse heed.
Than hadde hoel Ioye ynowh
For þat Arthour so hym sclowh; 
And for a perpetuel Memorie
He Made a chapełł of seynt Marye *. 
In þe hulle vpon þe pleyne,

And þat name wyþoute nay

Now ys an ende of þis þynge,
And artour haþ nyw tydynge:  *. 
Lucy þe Emperour wyþ hys host
Comeþ fast in gret bost;
Þey helyþ ouer ałł þe lond,
Page  13 Fowre hunderd þowsand  *. 
An hunderd & foure & twenty,—
Thus herawdes dude ham rekeny;—
Thus he hadde gadered to hym
Of cristiens and of Sarasyn, 
Wyþ ałł hys wytt & labour
To destroyen Arthour.
Arthour dude wyselye,
And hadde euer gode aspye 
Of lucyes gouernynge
And of hys þyder comynge;
But somme seyde hyt were folye *. 
To fyght aȝenst Emperour lucie, 
For he hadde sexe 1.  euere aȝenst oon,
& counceyled Arthour to fle & goon.
Wyþ þe Emperour come kynges Many oon,  , 
And ałł þeire power hoołł & soom; 
Stronger men Myȝt no man see,
As fułł of drede as þey myght be;
But / Arthour was nat dysmayd,
He tryst on god, & was wel payd,  *. 
And prayd þe hye trynyte
Euer hys help forto be;
And ałł hys Men wyþ oo voyse
Cryede to god wyþ Oo noyse, 
"Fader in heuene, þy wyłł be doon; *. 
Defende þy puple fram þeire foon,
And lat nat þe heþon̄ Men
Destroye þe puple crystien: 
Haue Mercy on þy seuan̄tis bonde,
And kepe ham fram þe heþon̄ honde; *. 
Page  14 Þe Muchelnesse of Men sainfayle
Ys nat victorie in Batayle; 
But after þe wyłł þat in heuene ys,
So þe victorie falleþ y-wys."
Than seyd Arthour, "hyt ys so: *. 
Auan̄t Baner, & be Goo." 
Now frendes ałł, for goddes loue,
Rereþ ȝowre hertes to god aboue,
And seyeþ ȝowre prayeris faste,
Þat we wełł spede furst & laste. 
¶ Pater noster.
The emperour tryst on hys men,
And þat haþ bygyled hym;
Forsothe hyt most nedeȝ be so,
For þey beþ cursed þat wełł hyt do, 
Sucħ ałł myght comeþ of god; *.

And sprad wyþ pryde his gunfanon̄;

Clefte Many a prowt Mannes heed: 
Hors & steedes gan to grent,
And deyde wyþ strokis þat þey hente;
Many a man þere lost hys lyf, 
Many on was wedyw þat was wyff; 
Þere men were wetschoede *.

Also he buryed Bedewere *.

And dude for ham Masse synge

Þer ys no man wel nye, y tryste,

And oþer knyȝtes Many moo:
Þan Arthour was heuy & woo.

He most nat come in þe toun:
Þan fled he to Wynchester
And wyth hys Mayne kep hym þer; 
And Arthour on gret haste
Pursywed after hym faste.

And how Mordred was flow,
And how to Cornewale he hym drow. 
Heo of Mercy hadde noon hoope,
Ther-for he dude on a Russet cote,
And to Carlyon̄ ys preuyly Ron̄ne, *. 
And made heore self þo a Non̄ne;

But of heore lyf þere made an ende.

And buryed ham þere, y vnderstonde.
Muche folke þerhenne he toke þo,
Of Northumber-lond also  *. 
Fram dyverse places to Arthour come
Hys wyłł to werk & to done:
Thus he sembled a fułł gret Ost;
To Cornewayle he draweþ hym fast 
After þat Mordred þe tratour
Þat hadde do hym Mucħ dyshonour.
That tretour hadde gret Strength  , 
And fulled þat lond on brede & lengtħ, 
Sucħ a batełł as þere was redy þo *. 
Hadde neuer Arthour byfore y-doo:
They fowȝt tyl þer come doun bloode
As a(.) Ryver or (.)a(.) flood;  *. 
Þey fowȝt euer sore & sadde;
Men nyst ho þe betere hadde;
But at þe last Certeyn
Was Mordred & alle hys y-sclayn;  *. 
And Arthour y-bete wyþ wounde, *.

But on lyter ryȝt anon *. 
Was browȝt to Auelon̄ 
Page  19 Þat was a place fayr & Mury;
Now hyt hooteþ Glastyngbury. *. 
Ther Arthour þat worthy kyng
Maked hys lyues endyng; 
But for he skaped þat batełł y-wys,
Breton̄s & Cornysch seyeþ þus,
"Þat he leuyth ȝut parde,
And schałł come & be a kyng aȝe."
